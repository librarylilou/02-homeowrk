# hw02-responsivePortfolio

A responsive webpage is important to the user of the web application for the reason that it creates a friendly experience for a variety of screen sizes, from phone, iPad, to desktop. The flexibility of the website's layout allows for the user to gain access on most, if not all platforms of their choosing. 

My motivation for this project was to learn how to implement the tools utilized to create a responsive webpage. In addition to getting aquainted with the source known as Bootstrap. I was most excited to finally get the opportunity to build my own website where any user or future employer could get to know me and my projects.
